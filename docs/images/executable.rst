Executable Images
==========================

Executable Images can be executed by the bootROM. They might be divided into three categories based on the additional information they provide: *Plain*, *Signed*, *Encrypted*.
Plain images provide just minimal additional information like for example image version and IVT table. Signed and encrypted images provide additional security to boot process.
