    "# Signature Provider Plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "The Signature Provider is a crucial component of SPSDK that facilitates secure signing operations using custom hardware security module (HSM). It acts as an interface between the SPSDK and the HSM, allowing developers to leverage the cryptographic capabilities of the HSM for signing data securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Benefits of using the Signature Provider\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Enhanced Security**:\n",
    "   - The Signature Provider enables the use of HSMs, which are designed to provide a high level of security for cryptographic operations. By keeping private keys within the HSM, the risk of key exposure is significantly reduced.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Custom HSM Support**:\n",
    "   - One of the standout features of the Signature Provider is its ability to work with custom HSMs. This flexibility allows organizations to integrate their existing security infrastructure into the SPSDK, ensuring that they can utilize their preferred hardware solutions.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Interoperability**:\n",
    "   - The Signature Provider is designed to be compatible with various HSMs and cryptographic standards. This interoperability ensures that organizations can switch between different HSMs or use multiple HSMs without significant changes to their codebase.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Audit and Compliance**:\n",
    "   - Using an HSM for signing operations can help organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements. The Signature Provider can facilitate logging and auditing of cryptographic operations, providing a clear trail for compliance purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how to setup a Signature Provider plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "When signing the data with SPSDK, there are two options:\n",
    "- Using the local private key (not recommended)\n",
    "- Using the remote signing service(HSM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the second option and setup Signature Provider \n"
