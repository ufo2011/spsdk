    "# Blhost (MBoot)\n",
    "Blhost is a tool that facilitates communication with the bootloader. It allows users to perform various operations such as programming firmware or configuring the bootloader settings. Blhost is typically used in development and debugging processes to interact with the bootloader on a target device.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The blhost provides several communication interfaces for interacting with NXP microcontrollers. The available communication interfaces are:\n",
    " - UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter): This is the most common communication interface used with the blhost utility. It allows you to communicate with the target microcontroller over a serial connection, such as a USB-to-UART adapter or the on-board UART interface of the microcontroller.\n",
    " - USB HID (Human Interface Device): The blhost utility can also communicate with the target microcontroller over a USB HID interface. This is useful when the microcontroller has a built-in USB HID interface, which can be used for communication without the need for a separate UART interface.\n",
    " - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): Some NXP microcontrollers support communication with the blhost utility over an SPI interface. This can be useful in scenarios where UART or USB are not available or convenient.\n",
    " - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit): Similar to SPI, the blhost utility can also communicate with the target microcontroller over an I2C interface.\n",
    " - CAN: Widely used communication protocol in the automotive and industrial sectors, and it is also supported by many NXP microcontrollers.\n",
    " - Buspal: Utility provided by NXP that allows you to communicate with and control various bus interfaces on NXP microcontrollers.\n",
    "\n",
    " For more information about the available configuration options for the communication interface, you can refer to the help message provided by the blhost utility. To access the help message, run the command\n",
    "`blhost --help`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific communication interfaces supported by the blhost utility may vary depending on the NXP microcontroller you are using. \n",
    "It's important to consult the documentation for your target microcontroller to determine which communication interfaces are available and how to configure them for use with the blhost utility.\n",
    "The supported communication interfaces can be also listed with command `spsdk utils family-info`"
