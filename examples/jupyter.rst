Jupyter notebooks
=================
We provide jupyter notebooks as an interactive documentation. To launch the notebook follow the installation guide here: https://jupyter.org/install.
For those unfamiliar with the jupyter environment we recommend this tutorial first: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html

.. note::

    You should install additional development requirements using **pip install spsdk[examples]** in order to run jupyter notebooks.
    Users using Windows 32bit need to install rust and add MSVC target: **rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc**
