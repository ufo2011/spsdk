    "DK6 Programming tool also known as DK6Prog is an alternative tool to [\"JN51xx Production Flash Programmer\"](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/JN-UG-3099.pdf). DK6Prog is part of the SPSDK and written in Python. DK6 is a name that was given to development kit for K32W, JN51xx and QN90xx devices.
